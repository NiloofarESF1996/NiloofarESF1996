# 👋 Welcome to Niloufar Esfahanian's GitHub

## 📌 About Me

I am a Data Analyst/Scientist with a Master’s degree in Data Science (with distinction) from the University of Sussex and a strong background in computational modelling. I specialise in extracting, collecting, analysing, and modelling data to generate clear, actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

My technical toolkit includes Power BI, Tableau, Python, SQL/MySQL and Excel. I build complete analytical solutions—from data extraction and transformation (using Power Query), to data modelling, DAX measures, statistical analysis, and machine learning—delivered through interactive dashboards and well-structured reports.
