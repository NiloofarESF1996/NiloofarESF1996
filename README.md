# 👋 Welcome to Niloufar Esfahanian's GitHub

## 📌 About Me

I am a **Data Analyst** with a Master’s degree in Data Science (with distinction) from the University of Sussex and a strong academic background in Physics and Astrophysics. I specialize in **extracting, collecting, analyzing, and modeling data** to generate clear, actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

My technical toolkit includes **Python**, **SQL/MySQL**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**. I build complete analytical solutions—from **data extraction and transformation (using Power Query)**, to **data modeling**, **DAX measures**, **statistical analysis**, and **machine learning**—delivered through **interactive dashboards** and well-structured reports.
